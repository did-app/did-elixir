# DID Elixir

DID is an Identity Provider, that authenticates users by verifying access to either an email address or securely stored private key.

## Examples

This repo contains Elixir applications that use DID authentication.

- [Phoenix](examples/elixir-phoenix-openid-connect)

## Where's the library?

There is no specific DID library needed to integrate with [did.app](https://did.app)
The openid connect library is all that is required.

Instead follow our guide for [using did with phoenix](https://did.app/guides/phoenix-elixir-openid-connect-integration/).
